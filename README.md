# TicTacToe Javascript tutorial follow along

This is a follow along tutorial from [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/c/WebDevSimplified). 

I hadn't coded in a little bit and wanted a nice tutorial to follow along and get back into it. I first started with watching the whole video through without coding. Then went back and followed along while coding. I haven't done a tutorial yet, most of my projects have been my own ones, but I think there is a place for following along because I get see more complex code than I would do on my own. Then try and add those complex ideas to my coding projects.

## Things I learned in this project

### New CSS techniques
- :nth-child
- ::before & ::after properties
- :not pseudo class

### Javascript
- a better understanding on how function parameters actually work
- function hoisting
- .every method
- . ! how the exclamation mark works in Javascript

### GIT
This is the first project that I had GIT installed on my computer. Still am not very effecient in it, but I am happy that I finally am using it on projects.
